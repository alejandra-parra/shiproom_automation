# Sprint Capacity Calculator

A Flask web application that calculates engineering team capacity for sprint planning by integrating data from multiple sources:

- **Workday API**: Fetches logged absences and time-off requests
- **PagerDuty API**: Identifies on-call duties and support responsibilities  
- **Public Holiday API**: Determines holidays based on team member locations
- **Manual Status Updates**: Allows real-time status adjustments

The application generates a comprehensive calendar view showing each team member's availability status for each day of a specified time period.

## Features

- üìÖ **Sprint Calendar Generation**: Visual calendar showing team availability
- üåç **Multi-location Support**: Handles distributed teams across different countries/regions
- üìä **Capacity Calculation**: Tracks individual capacity points and availability
- üîÑ **Real-time Updates**: Manual status overrides and adjustments

- ‚è∞ **Part-time Support**: Configurable non-working days for team members

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Access to the following APIs:
  - Workday API (for absence data)
  - PagerDuty API (for on-call schedules)
  

## Installation

1. **Navigate to the Sprint Capacity Calculator**
   ```bash
   cd SprintCapacityCalculator
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

   ```env
   # Workday API Configuration
   WORKDAY_TIMEOFF_URL=https://your-workday-instance.com/api/timeoff?start_date={start_date}&end_date={end_date}
   WORKDAY_USERNAME=your_workday_username
   WORKDAY_PASSWORD=your_workday_password

   # PagerDuty API Configuration
   PD_API_KEY=your_pagerduty_api_key
   PD_SCHEDULE_ID=your_pagerduty_schedule_id


   ```

## Configuration

### Team Configuration

Edit the `TEAM_DATA` dictionary in `config.py` to match your team:

```python
TEAM_DATA = {
    'Team Member Name': {
        'capacity': 10,           # Daily capacity points (8-10 typical)
        'location': 'GB-EN',      # Country-Region code for holidays
        'nonwork': ['fri'],       # Optional: non-working days for part-time
        'statuses': {}            # Auto-managed status tracking
    },
    # Add more team members...
}
```

#### Location Codes
Use ISO country codes with optional region suffixes:
- `GB-EN`: United Kingdom - England
- `DE-BY`: Germany - Bavaria  
- `DE-BE`: Germany - Berlin
- `US-CA`: United States - California
- `FR`: France (national holidays only)

#### Capacity Points
Typical values:
- `10`: Full-time (8 hours)
- `8`: Reduced capacity or part-time
- `6`: Significant part-time

### API Setup Instructions

#### Workday API
1. Contact Holli for access to credentials

#### PagerDuty API
1. Go to PagerDuty ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí API Access
2. Create a new API key with read permissions
3. Find your schedule ID from the schedule URL or API
4. Add both values to your `.env` file



## Usage

1. **Start the application**
   
   **Option 1: Command line (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```
   
   **Option 2: macOS double-click launcher**
   Double-click the `launch.command` file in Finder
   
   Both methods will:
   - Check your environment and dependencies
   - Start the Flask server on port 5001
   - Automatically open your browser to the application
   
   **Alternative: Direct start (requires activated virtual environment)**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the web interface**
   
   The application will automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:5001`

3. **Generate a sprint calendar**
   - Select start and end dates for your sprint
   - Click "Generate Calendar"
   - Review team availability and capacity

4. **Make manual adjustments**
   - Click on any cell to update a team member's status
   - Available statuses:
     - `Available`: Normal working capacity
     - `Planned Absence`: Pre-planned time off
     - `Unplanned Absence`: Sick leave or emergency absence
     - `Support`: On-call or support duties
     - `75% Available`: Partial availability
     - `50% Available`: Half-day availability
     - `25% Available`: Limited availability



## Status Definitions

The application uses color-coded statuses to provide a quick visual overview of team availability:

| Status | Description | Capacity Impact | Color |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| Available | Normal working day | Full capacity | üü¢ Green |
| Planned Absence | Pre-planned time off | 0% capacity | üü† Orange |
| Unplanned Absence | Sick leave, emergency | 0% capacity | üî¥ Red |
| Support | On-call or support duty | Reduced capacity | üîµ Blue |
| 75% Available | Minor conflicts/meetings | 75% capacity | üü° Yellow |
| 50% Available | Half-day availability | 50% capacity | üü° Yellow |
| 25% Available | Very limited availability | 25% capacity | üü° Yellow |
| Public Holiday | National/regional holiday | 0% capacity | üü£ Purple |
| No Workday | Part-time non-working day | 0% capacity | ‚ö´ Gray |

The **Total Capacity** row at the bottom shows the aggregate capacity calculation for each day, helping you quickly identify potential bottlenecks or low-capacity days during sprint planning.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   
   If you see "Address already in use" error:
   
   **Find what's using the port:**
   ```bash
   lsof -i :5001
   ```
   
   **Kill the process:**
   ```bash
   # Replace PID with the actual process ID from lsof output
   kill -9 PID
   ```
   
   **Or kill all Python processes (use with caution):**
   ```bash
   pkill -f python
   ```

2. **App Won't Stop (Ctrl+C doesn't work)**
   
   **Find the Flask process:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep python | grep app.py
   ```
   
   **Kill it:**
   ```bash
   kill -9 PID
   ```
   
   **Or find and kill by port:**
   ```bash
   lsof -ti:5001 | xargs kill -9
   ```

3. **Multiple Instances Running**
   
   **Kill all Flask/Python processes:**
   ```bash
   # List all Python processes
   ps aux | grep python
   
   # Kill specific Flask processes
   pkill -f "python.*app.py"
   pkill -f "python.*run.py"
   ```

4. **API Connection Errors**
   - Verify all API credentials in `.env` file
   - Check network connectivity and firewall settings
   - Ensure API endpoints are accessible

5. **Missing Team Members**
   - Ensure team member names match exactly between systems
   - Check that all team members are added to `TEAM_DATA`
   - Verify location codes are valid

6. **Holiday Data Issues**
   - Confirm location codes follow ISO standards
   - Check that the public holiday API is accessible
   - Verify date ranges don't span too many years

### Emergency Stop Commands

**Option 1: Use the kill script (easiest)**
```bash
./kill_app.sh
```

**Option 2: Manual commands**
```bash
# Kill by port (safest)
lsof -ti:5001 | xargs kill -9

# Kill by process name (more aggressive)
pkill -f "Sprint.*Calculator"
pkill -f "python.*run.py"
pkill -f "python.*app.py"
```

### Debug Mode

Run the application in debug mode for detailed error messages:

```bash
export FLASK_DEBUG=1  # On Windows: set FLASK_DEBUG=1
python3 app.py
```
