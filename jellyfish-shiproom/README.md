## ðŸš€ Quick Start

If you're switching between different projects in this repository, here's how to get this project running:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to this project directory
cd jellyfish-shiproom

# 2. Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies (if not already installed)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the script
python jellyfish_status_report.py --config config.yaml
```

**Note:** This project uses a `.venv` virtual environment (not `venv`). Make sure you're activating the correct one!

## Setup

### 1. Virtual Environment Setup

This project uses a `.venv` virtual environment. If you need to create a new one:

```bash
# Create new virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# OR
.venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Make sure your virtual environment is activated
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```bash
# Google Service Account Configuration
# Option 1: Path to JSON file
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=/path/to/your/service-account-key.json

# Option 2: JSON content directly (recommended for deployment)
# GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='{"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project",...}'

# Jellyfish API Configuration
JELLYFISH_BASE_URL=https://app.jellyfish.co/endpoints/export/v0
JELLYFISH_API_KEY=your-jellyfish-api-key-here

# Jira API Configuration (Optional - for due date history)
JIRA_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net
JIRA_EMAIL=your-email@domain.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-jira-api-token
```

### 4. Google Service Account Setup

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Google Slides API
4. Create a Service Account:
   - Go to IAM & Admin > Service Accounts
   - Click "Create Service Account"
   - Give it a name and description
   - Download the JSON key file
5. Share your Google Slides presentation with the service account email address (with Editor permissions)

### 4.1. Service Account JSON Formatting

You have two options for providing the service account credentials:

**Option 1: File Path (simpler for local development)**
```bash
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE=/path/to/your/service-account-key.json
```

**Option 2: JSON Content (recommended for deployment/CI/CD)**
```bash
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='{"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id","private_key_id":"key-id","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvgIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKgwggSkAgEAAoIBAQC...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n","client_email":"your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com","client_id":"123456789","auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs","client_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/your-service-account%40your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"}'
```

**Important formatting notes for Option 2:**
- Wrap the entire JSON in single quotes (`'...'`)
- Keep all the JSON on one line (no line breaks)
- The private key will contain `\n` characters - keep these as-is
- Don't escape the quotes inside the JSON when using single quotes outside

**Quick conversion from file to environment variable:**
```bash
# On macOS/Linux, you can convert your JSON file to a one-liner:
cat your-service-account.json | tr -d '\n' | sed "s/'/\\\'/g"

# Then copy the output and wrap it in single quotes in your .env file:
# GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='paste-the-output-here'
```

### 5. Configuration File

The `config.yaml` file is already configured for Team Tolkien. Update it if needed:

```yaml
# Configuration file - credentials come from environment variables
# Non-sensitive configuration goes here

# Required: Google Slides presentation to update
google_slides:
  presentation_id: "your-presentation-id-here"
  slide_id: "your-slide-id-here"

# Required: Team configuration
team:
  team_id: "your-team-id"
  team_name: "Your Team Name"
```

**Note:** To find your Google Presentation ID and Slide ID:

**Presentation ID:**
- Open your Google Slides presentation
- Look at the URL: `https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ABC123DEF456/edit`
- The presentation ID is: `1ABC123DEF456`

**Slide ID:**
- Navigate to the specific slide you want to update
- Look at the URL: `https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ABC123DEF456/edit#slide=id.g789XYZ123_0_0`
- The slide ID is: `g789XYZ123_0_0` (everything after `slide=id.`)
- Alternatively, right-click on the slide thumbnail in the left panel and select "Copy link" - the slide ID will be in that URL

**Important:** All credentials (API keys, tokens, passwords) MUST be in the `.env` file. The config file is only for non-sensitive configuration like team IDs and presentation IDs.

## Usage

### Generate Status Report

```bash
# Make sure you're in the jellyfish-shiproom directory
cd jellyfish-shiproom

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run the script for ALL teams (default behaviour if not specified)
python jellyfish_status_report.py --config config.yaml --team all

# Run the script for a SINGLE team (only that slide is updated)
python jellyfish_status_report.py --config config.yaml --team TOL

# You can also omit --team to fall back to whatever is set in config / defaults to all
python jellyfish_status_report.py --config config.yaml
```

### Team Selection Logic

The script now supports generating slides for either:

1. A single team (only that team's slide is cleared and re-generated)
2. All teams listed in `teams_config.yaml`

Selection priority (highest wins):
1. `--team` CLI argument
2. `team_selection` key in `config.yaml` (optional)
3. Fallback default: `all`

Valid values for `--team` / `team_selection`:
- `all` â€“ process every configured team
- A team identifier key from `teams_config.yaml` (e.g. `BBEE`, `TOL`, `CLIP`, etc.)

If you pass a team identifier that does not exist, the script will list all available keys.

### Required Supporting File: `teams_config.yaml`

Multi-team execution depends on `teams_config.yaml`, which defines each team's mapping:

```yaml
teams:
   TOL:
      jira_project_key: "TOL"
      team_name: "[PRD] Tolkien: [TOL]"
      team_id: 44743
      slide_id: "id.slide_20250719_151730"   # Optional â€“ strip leading 'id.' automatically
      presenter: ""                           # Optional metadata
      image_link: ""                          # Optional metadata
```

Fields:
- `jira_project_key` (required)
- `team_name` (required)
- `team_id` (required â€“ Jellyfish team ID)
- `slide_id` (optional) If missing or invalid the script creates a new slide and prints its ID
- `presenter`, `image_link` (optional)

Validation: A team missing any required field or with an empty `jira_project_key` is skipped.

### How Slides Are Updated

For each selected team:
1. Existing slide content is cleared (if `slide_id` exists and slide is found)
2. If the slide does not exist or no `slide_id` is configured, a new blank slide is created and its new ID is printed (copy it back into `teams_config.yaml` for future runs)
3. Deliverables and epics are fetched for the date range
4. Each item is enriched with Jira due date history + labels (if available)
5. Items are filtered based on lookback logic; excluded items are added off-canvas for traceability
6. A merged table plus a Risks / Mitigations box is rendered

### Example Workflows

Update only Tolkien:
```bash
python jellyfish_status_report.py --config config.yaml --team TOL
```

Regenerate every team slide:
```bash
python jellyfish_status_report.py --config config.yaml --team all
```

Run using `team_selection` specified in `config.yaml` (e.g. set `team_selection: CLIP`):
```bash
python jellyfish_status_report.py --config config.yaml
```

### Adding a New Team
1. Add an entry under `teams:` in `teams_config.yaml` with required fields
2. (Optional) Leave out `slide_id` on the first run â€“ the script will create a slide and print the new ID
3. Re-run after copying the printed slide ID into the config for stable updates

### Troubleshooting Team Runs
- Slide not cleared: Ensure the `slide_id` matches the actual Google Slides object ID (remove any duplicated `id.` prefix; the script strips one automatically)
- New slide created every run: You forgot to add / persist the created `slide_id` back into `teams_config.yaml`
- Team skipped: Check logs for missing required field warning
- No items shown: Confirm Jellyfish team ID is correct and date range has data

### Verify Setup

The script will output detailed information about:
- API connections (Jellyfish, Jira, Google Slides)
- Data fetching and processing
- Table generation in Google Slides

If everything is working, you should see:
- "Report generated in Google Slides" at the end
- No error messages
- Detailed logging of the process

## Changelog Management

This project maintains a detailed changelog to track all changes and improvements. The changelog follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format.

- `changed` - Changes to existing functionality
- `deprecated` - Soon-to-be removed features
- `removed` - Removed features
- `fixed` - Bug fixes
- `security` - Security-related changes

### Version Management

Since this is one feature folder in a larger repository, versioning is scoped to this feature:

1. Update the version number in the changelog (e.g., `jellyfish-shiproom v1.1.0`)
2. Move entries from the current version to a new version when ready
3. Add a release date
4. Optionally tag the release in git with feature prefix

Example:
```bash
# Create a feature-specific version tag
git tag -a jellyfish-shiproom-v1.1.0 -m "Jellyfish Status Report v1.1.0"
git push origin jellyfish-shiproom-v1.1.0
```

### Multi-Project Repository Notes

This changelog tracks changes specific to the jellyfish-shiproom feature. Other features in this repository may have their own changelogs or use a different versioning strategy.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Wrong Virtual Environment**: Make sure you're using `.venv`, not `venv`
   ```bash
   # Check which Python you're using
   which python
   # Should show: /path/to/jellyfish-shiproom/.venv/bin/python
   ```

2. **Missing Dependencies**: If you get import errors
   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Environment Variables**: Make sure your `.env` file exists and has the correct values
   ```bash
   # Check if .env file exists
   ls -la .env
   ```

4. **API Permissions**: Ensure your service account has access to the Google Slides presentation

### Switching Between Projects

When switching between different projects in this repository:

```bash
# Deactivate current environment (if any)
deactivate

# Navigate to the jellyfish-shiproom project
cd jellyfish-shiproom

# Activate this project's environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Verify you're in the right environment
which python
# Should show: .../jellyfish-shiproom/.venv/bin/python
```
